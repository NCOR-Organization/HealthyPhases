# Research Aims

The HealthPhases Project is structured around three primary research aims that guide our scientific approach and methodology:

## Aim 1: Ontology Development

Our first aim focuses on developing robust ontological frameworks to standardize terminology and relationships in solitude and gerotranscendence research.

### Objectives
- **Consensus Building**: Work with domain experts to establish agreed-upon definitions of key terms
- **Formal Representation**: Create machine-readable representations of terms and their relationships
- **Competency Questions**: Develop and test questions that guide ontology design and validate its sufficiency
- **Term Definition**: Precisely define terms like "solitude," "loneliness," "isolation," and "gerotranscendence"
- **Relationship Modeling**: Map the complex relationships between different aspects of being alone and well-being

### Methods
- Expert workshops and consensus-building exercises
- Formal ontology development using standard languages (OWL)
- Integration with existing upper-level ontologies
- Validation through competency questions and use cases

## Aim 2: Ontology-Based Web Resources

Our second aim is to create practical web-based resources that implement the ontological framework and support research and practice.

### Common Data Model
- Standardize data elements for collecting solitude and gerotranscendence data
- Provide a simplified data model that researchers can easily adopt
- Promote data sharing and interoperability across studies

### Semantic Enrichment
- Use ontology to build knowledge graphs for inference and data harmonization
- Add metadata (e.g., synonyms, related terms) to enhance retrieval and analysis
- Support data quality through SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) validation

### Technical Implementation
- Develop web interfaces for data annotation and exploration
- Create SPARQL endpoints for querying semantically enriched data
- Implement Large Language Models for Q/A and recommendations based on the ontology

## Aim 3: Promotion and Dissemination

Our third aim focuses on promoting the adoption of our ontological framework and resources across the research community.

### Research Community Engagement
- Present at gerontology conferences:
  - Gerontological Society of America (GSA) Annual Scientific Meeting
  - International Society for the Study of Behavioral Development (ISSBD) biennial meeting

- Present at ontology/semantic technology conferences:
  - International Conference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO)
  - Formal Ontology in Information Systems (FOIS)
  - Annual Knowledge Graph Conference (KGC)
  - U.S. Semantic Technologies Symposium Series (US2TS)

### Educational Resources
- Develop training materials and documentation
- Host workshops for researchers in gerontology and aging studies
- Create guides for implementing the common data model

### Sustainability Planning
- Establish long-term maintenance procedures
- Develop community governance models
- Create pipelines for ongoing ontology evolution and refinement

Through these three interconnected aims, the HealthPhases Project will create a semantic foundation that bridges isolated research areas and advances our understanding of the complex relationship between solitude experiences and healthy aging.
