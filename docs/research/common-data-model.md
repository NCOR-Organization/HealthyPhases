# HealthPhases Common Data Model

The HealthPhases Common Data Model (CDM) provides a standardized structure for collecting, representing, and sharing data related to solitude and gerotranscendence research.

## Purpose

The Common Data Model addresses several challenges in current research:

- **Inconsistent Terminology**: Different studies use different terms for similar concepts
- **Variable Definitions**: Measurements and variables are defined inconsistently
- **Data Integration Barriers**: Different data formats make comparison and integration difficult
- **Limited Reusability**: Specialized data structures inhibit reuse across studies

## Core Components

The HealthPhases CDM includes the following components:

### 1. Demographic Variables
Standardized demographic attributes with precise definitions:
- Age (with specific age ranges for older adults)
- Gender and sex
- Cultural and ethnic background
- Socioeconomic factors
- Living situation
- Relationship status

### 2. Solitude Assessment
Standardized measures of solitude experiences:
- Time spent alone (objective measures)
- Quality of solitude experiences
- Voluntary vs. involuntary solitude
- Context of solitude (e.g., at home, in nature)
- Activities during solitude

### 3. Loneliness Assessment
Validated instruments for measuring loneliness:
- UCLA Loneliness Scale
- De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale
- Campaign to End Loneliness Measurement Tool
- Three-Item Loneliness Scale

### 4. Social Isolation Measures
Objective measures of social connection:
- Social network size
- Frequency of social interactions
- Types of relationships
- Social participation

### 5. Gerotranscendence Scales
Standardized instruments for assessing gerotranscendence:
- Gerotranscendence Scale (GS)
- Modified Gerotranscendence Scale
- Gerotranscendence Interview Assessment

### 6. Well-being and Health Measures
Standard instruments for assessing outcomes:
- Life satisfaction scales
- Depression measures
- Anxiety measures
- Physical health indicators
- Cognitive health assessments

## Implementation

### Data Dictionary
Each variable in the CDM is accompanied by:
- Precise definition
- Allowed values or measurement scale
- Mapping to standard terminologies
- Provenance information
- Usage notes

### Data Format Standards
The CDM can be implemented in multiple formats:
- REDCap data collection instruments
- CSV templates with standardized headers
- JSON schema
- RDF/OWL representations
- SQL database schemas

### Mapping Tools
Tools for mapping existing datasets to the CDM:
- Terminology crosswalks
- Data transformation scripts
- Validation mechanisms

## Using the Common Data Model

### For New Studies
Researchers planning new studies can:
1. Download the CDM templates
2. Incorporate recommended measures
3. Use standardized variable definitions
4. Collect data according to the model
5. Share data in the standard format

### For Existing Data
Researchers with existing datasets can:
1. Map variables to CDM definitions
2. Transform data to the standard format
3. Validate data against the model
4. Document any deviations from the standard

## Benefits

Using the HealthPhases CDM provides numerous benefits:

- **Enhanced Comparability**: Studies using the CDM can be directly compared
- **Simplified Meta-Analysis**: Standard variables facilitate across-study analysis
- **Improved Data Quality**: Standardized definitions reduce ambiguity
- **Easier Data Sharing**: Common formats streamline data exchange
- **Semantic Enrichment**: Ready alignment with ontological frameworks

## Development Process

The HealthPhases CDM is developed through an iterative, community-involved process:

1. Literature review of existing measures
2. Expert consultation and consensus building
3. Draft specification development
4. Community feedback and revision
5. Pilot testing in research studies
6. Ongoing refinement based on implementation experience
