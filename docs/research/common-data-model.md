# Common Data Model

The HealthyPhases Common Data Model (CDM) provides a standardized framework for organizing and integrating data related to solitude, social connection, and gerotranscendence research.

## Overview

The CDM defines a consistent representation of data that enables researchers and practitioners to:

1. Share data using common terminology and formats
2. Integrate findings across diverse studies and populations
3. Compare results using standardized measures and definitions
4. Build knowledge graphs and semantic tools that operate across datasets

## Key Features

### Standardized Entity Types

The CDM defines core entity types required for representing solitude and gerotranscendence phenomena:

- **Person**: Demographic and baseline information about study participants
- **Assessment**: Standardized measures used to evaluate solitude, loneliness, etc.
- **Social Context**: Environmental and social factors influencing experiences
- **Temporal Patterns**: Changes and trajectories over time
- **Wellbeing Outcomes**: Physical, psychological, and social outcomes

### Semantic Mappings

Each entity and relationship in the CDM is mapped to formal ontology terms, enabling:

- Clear definition of meaning
- Resolution of terminological differences
- Connection to broader biomedical knowledge
- Automated reasoning and inference

### Flexible Implementation

The CDM can be implemented in various formats:

- Relational database schemas
- Graph database models
- JSON schemas for API development
- RDF/OWL for semantic web applications

## Development Process

The CDM was developed through a collaborative process involving:

1. **Domain Analysis**: Review of key research papers, existing measures, and data structures
2. **Requirements Gathering**: Input from researchers, clinicians, and data scientists
3. **Ontological Mapping**: Alignment with BFO, CCO, and domain ontologies
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Testing with real datasets and use cases
5. **Community Feedback**: Reviews by researchers and technical experts
