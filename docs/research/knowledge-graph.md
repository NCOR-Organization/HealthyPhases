# HealthPhases Knowledge Graph

The HealthPhases Knowledge Graph is a semantically rich network of connected information about solitude, gerotranscendence, and healthy aging research.

## What is a Knowledge Graph?

A knowledge graph is a structured representation of knowledge that:

- Organizes information as entities (nodes) and relationships (edges)
- Integrates data from multiple sources into a unified structure
- Enables complex queries across connected information
- Supports inference to derive new insights from existing knowledge
- Provides context and provenance for information

## The HealthPhases Knowledge Graph

Our knowledge graph integrates diverse information related to solitude and gerotranscendence research:

### Core Components

#### Entities (Nodes)
- **Research Concepts**: Terms and constructs like "solitude," "loneliness," "isolation"
- **Measurement Instruments**: Scales and assessment tools
- **Research Studies**: Publications, datasets, and findings
- **Researchers**: Authors, investigators, and research groups
- **Population Groups**: Demographic and clinical populations studied

#### Relationships (Edges)
- **Conceptual Relations**: How concepts relate to each other (e.g., "subtypeOf," "partOf")
- **Evidential Links**: How findings support or contradict hypotheses
- **Measurement Relations**: How instruments measure specific constructs
- **Temporal Connections**: How concepts and findings evolve over time
- **Causal Relationships**: How factors influence outcomes

### Knowledge Graph Schema

The HealthPhases Knowledge Graph is structured according to a formal schema:

- **Based on HealthPhases Ontology**: Aligned with our core ontological framework
- **RDF/OWL Format**: Uses standard semantic web technologies
- **Linked Data Principles**: Follows best practices for knowledge representation
- **Named Graphs**: Tracks provenance and context for all assertions
- **Formal Axioms**: Enables reasoning and inference

## Applications

The knowledge graph supports multiple applications within the HealthPhases Project:

### Research Discovery
- Finding relevant studies and publications
- Identifying gaps in current research
- Discovering unexpected connections between concepts
- Tracking the evolution of research over time

### Data Integration
- Integrating findings from diverse studies
- Harmonizing data across different measurement instruments
- Connecting results across disciplines
- Contextualizing findings within broader knowledge

### Question Answering
- Powering semantic search capabilities
- Supporting natural language queries
- Providing evidence-based answers to research questions
- Explaining relationships between concepts

### Hypothesis Generation
- Identifying promising research directions
- Suggesting novel conceptual connections
- Highlighting unexplored causal pathways
- Supporting evidence-based research planning

## Accessing the Knowledge Graph

The HealthPhases Knowledge Graph is accessible through multiple interfaces:

### SPARQL Endpoint
For direct querying using the SPARQL query language:
```sparql
PREFIX hp: <https://healthyphases.org/ontology/>

SELECT ?study ?finding
WHERE {
  ?study a hp:ResearchStudy ;
         hp:investigates hp:Solitude ;
         hp:reports ?finding .
  ?finding hp:aboutConcept hp:Gerotranscendence .
}
```

### Knowledge Graph Browser
An interactive visual interface for exploring connections between entities.

### API Access
Programmatic access for integration with research tools and applications.

### Data Downloads
Downloadable subsets of the knowledge graph in various formats (RDF, JSON-LD, CSV).

## Contributing to the Knowledge Graph

The HealthPhases Knowledge Graph is a community resource that grows through contributions:

### How to Contribute
- **Add Publications**: Submit relevant papers for inclusion
- **Contribute Datasets**: Share your research data with semantic annotations
- **Suggest Relationships**: Identify conceptual connections
- **Report Errors**: Help improve accuracy and completeness
- **Extend the Schema**: Propose new entity types or relationships

### Contribution Guidelines
- All contributions must include appropriate provenance
- Assertions should be linked to supporting evidence
- Contributions undergo review before integration
- Conflicts are resolved through community consensus

## Technical Implementation

The HealthPhases Knowledge Graph is implemented using modern semantic technologies:

- **Triple Store**: High-performance graph database
- **Reasoning Engine**: OWL2 reasoning capabilities
- **Entity Resolution**: Automatic linking of identical entities
- **Versioning**: Tracking changes over time
- **Authentication**: Secure access controls for contributors
