# Knowledge Graph

The HealthyPhases Knowledge Graph is a semantically-rich, interconnected representation of solitude and gerotranscendence research findings, concepts, and data.

## What is a Knowledge Graph?

A knowledge graph is a structured representation of knowledge where:

- **Entities** (people, concepts, studies, measures) are represented as nodes
- **Relationships** between entities are represented as labeled connections
- **Properties** provide attributes and details about the entities
- **Context** gives meaning and provenance to the information

Unlike traditional databases, knowledge graphs excel at representing complex, interconnected information from diverse sources.

## The HealthyPhases Knowledge Graph

Our knowledge graph integrates multiple types of information:

- **Research Findings**: Results from published studies
- **Concepts and Definitions**: Terminology and formal definitions
- **Measurement Instruments**: Structure and use of assessment tools
- **Expert Knowledge**: Insights from domain specialists
- **Data Patterns**: Derived trends and relationships

## Key Features

### Interconnected Structure

The knowledge graph connects related concepts across traditional boundaries:

- Links between psychological, social, and physical aspects of aging
- Connections between subjective experiences and objective measures
- Integration of findings across disciplines and methodologies

### Semantic Foundation

Built on formal ontological principles:

- Aligned with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)
- Incorporates terms from multiple domain ontologies
- Provides precise definitions for all concepts
- Supports logical inference and reasoning

### Flexible Exploration

The graph can be explored from multiple perspectives:

- By concept (e.g., "voluntary solitude")
- By study or publication
- By measurement approach
- By population characteristics
- By outcomes and correlates

## Applications

### For Researchers

- **Hypothesis Generation**: Discover potential relationships to investigate
- **Literature Exploration**: Find relevant research across disciplinary boundaries
- **Research Context**: Understand how your work fits into the broader knowledge landscape
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify understudied areas or relationships

### For Practitioners

- **Evidence Summary**: Access integrated evidence on specific questions
- **Intervention Planning**: Identify factors that influence outcomes
- **Assessment Selection**: Find appropriate measures for specific contexts
- **Client Education**: Visualize relationships for client discussions

### For Data Scientists

- **Data Integration**: Connect your datasets to a broader knowledge context
- **Enrichment Source**: Use the graph to enrich your data
- **Feature Identification**: Discover potential variables for models
- **Pattern Validation**: Compare discovered patterns with known relationships

## Accessing the Knowledge Graph

### Visual Explorer

Our web-based interface allows visual exploration of the graph through:

- Interactive network visualizations
- Guided exploration paths
- Filtering by entity types and relationships
- Custom visualizations for specific questions

### Query Interface

For more technical users, we provide:
