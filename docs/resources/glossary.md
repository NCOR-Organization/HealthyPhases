# Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions of key terms used in the HealthPhases Project and in solitude and gerotranscendence research more broadly.

## Solitude and Social Concepts

### Solitude
The objective state of being physically alone or experiencing an absence of social interaction. Solitude can be either positive or negative depending on context, choice, and individual differences.

### Loneliness
A subjective feeling of dissatisfaction with one's social relationships, characterized by a perceived disconnection from others. Loneliness can occur even when surrounded by other people.

### Social Isolation
An objective lack of social connections or interactions, typically measured by the size, diversity, and frequency of social contacts.

### Aloneness
The general condition of being by oneself, which encompasses both voluntary (solitude) and involuntary (isolation) forms.

### Social Connection
The experience of feeling close and connected to others. The opposite of loneliness.

### Voluntary Solitude
Time spent alone by choice, often associated with positive outcomes such as reflection, creativity, and emotional regulation.

### Involuntary Solitude
Being alone against one's wishes or preferences, often associated with negative outcomes similar to loneliness.

## Gerotranscendence Concepts

### Gerotranscendence
A developmental shift in perspective that can occur in later life, characterized by transcendent changes in one's relationship to self, others, and the universe.

### Cosmic Dimension
A component of gerotranscendence involving changes in how one perceives time, space, life, and death, often including an increased feeling of connection to past and future generations.

### Self Dimension
A component of gerotranscendence characterized by decreased self-centeredness, increased self-acceptance, and rediscovery of childhood aspects of the self.

### Social Dimension
A component of gerotranscendence involving changes in the meaning and importance of social relationships, often including greater selectivity in social choices and less concern with superficial interactions.

### Life Review
The process of reflecting on one's life experiences, often associated with gerotranscendence and the search for coherence and meaning in one's life narrative.

### Ego Integrity
In Erikson's developmental theory, the achievement of a sense of coherence and wholeness in one's life, as opposed to despair. Related to gerotranscendence.

## Aging and Well-being Concepts

### Successful Aging
A multidimensional concept encompassing physical health, cognitive functioning, and social engagement in later life.

### Healthy Aging
The process of developing and maintaining functional ability that enables well-being in older age.

### Subjective Well-being
An individual's cognitive and affective evaluation of their life, including both life satisfaction judgments and emotional reactions.

### Quality of Life
A multidimensional concept encompassing physical, psychological, social, and environmental aspects of well-being.

### Depression
A mental health disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest, and impaired daily functioning.

### Cognitive Function
Mental processes including attention, memory, language, problem-solving, and decision-making.

## Semantic Technology Concepts

### Ontology
A formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization, providing a structured framework for organizing knowledge in a domain.

### Knowledge Graph
A semantic network representing entities and their relationships, enabling complex queries and inference across connected information.

### Semantic Enrichment
The process of enhancing data with structured, machine-interpretable annotations that add meaning and context.

### Common Data Model
A standardized framework for organizing and describing data that promotes interoperability and integration.

### Competency Question
A natural language question that an ontology should be able to answer, used to guide development and evaluate completeness.

### Consensus Building
The process of developing agreement among domain experts about the meanings and relationships of key terms in a domain.

### SPARQL
A query language for retrieving and manipulating data stored in knowledge graphs using RDF (Resource Description Framework) format.

## Research Assessment Concepts

### UCLA Loneliness Scale
A widely used measure of subjective feelings of loneliness and social isolation.

### De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale
A scale measuring loneliness with emotional and social loneliness subscales.

### Gerotranscendence Scale (GS)
A measurement instrument designed to assess the degree of gerotranscendence experienced by older adults.

### Social Network Size

### Social Participation

### Life Satisfaction
A cognitive assessment of one's overall contentment with life, often measured using scales like the Satisfaction with Life Scale.

## Data Integration Concepts

### Interoperability
The ability of different information systems, devices, or applications to connect, exchange, and use data coherently.

### Data Harmonization
The process of bringing together data from different sources and making it comparable through standardization.

### Semantic Annotation
The process of attaching semantic metadata to data elements, linking them to formal definitions in an ontology.

### Metadata
Information that describes other data, providing context and enhancing understanding and usability.

### Provenance
Information about the origin, chain of custody, and transformations applied to data.

### SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language)
A language for validating RDF graphs against a set of conditions, used for data quality assurance.
