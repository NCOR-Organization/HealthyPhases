# Portal Development

The HealthyPhases website serves as our comprehensive research portal - a web-based platform designed to facilitate exploration, discovery, and analysis of solitude and gerotranscendence research through semantic enrichment and AI-powered tools.

## Portal Overview

In the context of the solitude and gerotranscendence literatures, the growth and complexity of research necessitates the development of efficient systems for organizing, accessing, and extracting insights from these research areas. We have created a new web portal through which researchers, clinicians, educators, and students may interact with semantically enriched solitude and gerotranscendence data.

## Core Services

The portal provides two major services to stakeholders:

### 1. Recommender System

A recommender system for solitude and gerotranscendence research provides automated recommendations for research themes, articles, and authors based on stakeholder profiles and preferences.

**Technical Approach:**
- Ontologies and knowledge graphs enrich the recommender system
- Reduces the need for large amounts of training data through formal specification of entities and relationships
- Provides robust explanations for recommendations through clear logical reasoning
- Hosted recommender system enriched by the ontologies developed in Aim 1
- Allows researchers to remain up-to-date on cutting-edge work in these respective fields

**Current Status:** In Development

### 2. Question-Answer System

A question-answer system for solitude and gerotranscendence research allows stakeholders to pose natural language questions about constructs, methods, and findings across solitude and gerotranscendence literatures.

**Current Technical Implementation:**
- **LLM Integration**: Gemini free API with basic system prompt
- **ABI Framework**: Open source Agentic Brain Infrastructure for API orchestration
- **PubMed Integration**: Direct API calls to retrieve and analyze research papers
- **Ontology-Driven Search**: Leverages solitude and gerotranscendence ontologies for enhanced paper discovery
- **Downloadable Links**: Provides direct access to research papers and resources

**Current Capabilities:**
- Natural language queries about solitude and gerotranscendence research
- PubMed paper discovery and retrieval
- Ontology-based search result enhancement
- Direct links to downloadable research papers

**Current Status:** Phase 3 Active - Access the Q&A system at [/chat](/chat)
