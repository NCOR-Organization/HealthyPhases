  example: "On a somewhat higher level of complexity are what we shall call rate process
    profiles, which are the targets of selective abstraction focused not on determinate
    quality magnitudes plotted over time, but rather on certain ratios between these
    magnitudes and elapsed times. A speed process profile, for example, is represented
    by a graph plotting against time the ratio of distance covered per unit of time.
    Since rates may change, and since such changes, too, may have rates of change,
    we have to deal here with a hierarchy of process profile universals at successive
    levels; One important sub-family of rate process profiles is illustrated by the
    beat or frequency profiles of cyclical processes, illustrated by the 60 beats
    per minute beating process of John\u2019s heart, or the 120 beats per minute drumming
    process involved in one of John\u2019s performances in a rock band, and so on.
    Each such process includes what we shall call a beat process profile instance
    as part, a subtype of rate process profile in which the salient ratio is not distance
    covered but rather number of beat cycles per unit of time. Each beat process profile
    instance instantiates the determinable universal beat process profile. But it

    cycles by the length of the temporal region occupied by the beating process profile
    as a whole. Irregular process profiles of this sort, for example as identified
    in the clinic, or in the readings on an aircraft instrument panel, are often of
    diagnostic significance.; The simplest type of process profiles are what we shall
